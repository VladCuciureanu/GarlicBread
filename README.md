<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- Photo of this project TBA -->

With my private Discord server slowly rising in members count, I had to face the cold hard truth...\
Something was still missing...
So I made this bot to fill both metaphorical holes in the server and in my heart.

Implemented features:
 * Custom role name and color
 * Hot-swappable modules (cogs)
 * Purge messages
 * Uwu

Planned features:
 * Guilds (custom visible role name for >2 players at all times)
 * Local DB integration

### Built With

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
* [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
